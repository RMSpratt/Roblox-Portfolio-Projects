# Roblox Project Portfolio

## Large Coding Projects
My larger Roblox projects mostly comprise personal projects for implementing frameworks and/or experimenting in Lua.

### Tycoon Framework 
An early project inspired by earlier Tycoons was the creation of a reusable framework for managing Tycoon systems.
The key components are outlined in the TycoonFramework sub-directory.

A modified version of the Framework was used for a game submission for school and an unreleased Roblox game, (still playable).

## Small Coding Projects
I have also worked on creating a number of smaller coding projects.

These have not been directly applied to published games, but have been abstracted as templates for future possible use.

### Chat Filters
I created a set of custom chat filters to create "ghost chatrooms" that hide messages from a general chatroom. 
An example application for this code is for creating a Lobby chatroom that hides messages from players in an active round of gameplay.

### Global Leaderboard
I worked on creating global leaderboards capable of tracking different stats and updating in real time.
Updates are handled on the Server and passed to the client where they are animated for display.

An animated video can be found here: [Animated Leaderboard](./GlobalLeaderboard/Images-Video/Leaderboard-Displays.mp4).

### Tool Re-working
I have re-created the functionality for several classic Roblox gear, restoring thier functionality using updated features
such as FilteringEnabled. Samples can be found [Here](./Tools).
