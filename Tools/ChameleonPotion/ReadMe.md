# ChameleonPotion
The Chameleon Potion Tool https://www.roblox.com/catalog/61916137/Chameleon-Potion, allows the 
user to turn into any other humanoid character or player in the game with a simple mouse click.

The player will maintain the full appearance and animations of the target for a fixed duration of time.

## Changes
In-order to have this tool work with updated Roblox features and comply with new policies,
some changes were made to the implementation and functionality of the tool.

- FilteringEnabled is used for client Raycasts to a Target
- A new R15 animation is used
- A modified R6 animation is used
- Default clothing is applied if not present (Shirt + Pants)
- Configuration option table

**Note:** The default clothing IDs are set to Roblox's default options, but can be altered.
