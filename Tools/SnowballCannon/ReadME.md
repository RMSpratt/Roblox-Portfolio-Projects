# SnowballCannon

The SnowballCannon Tool https://www.roblox.com/catalog/30392263/Decoy-Deploy, is a ranged weapon
that shoots snowballs obscuring a target player's screen.

The snowballs themselves are otherwise harmless.

## Changes
In-order to have this tool work with updated Roblox features some changes were made to the 
implementation and functionality of the tool.

- RemoteEvent message passing
- Modified MouseIcon script
- Configuration option table
