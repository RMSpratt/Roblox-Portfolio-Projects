# DecoyDeploy

The DecoyDeploy Tool https://www.roblox.com/catalog/30392263/Decoy-Deploy, allows the 
user to create a clone of their character that will explode if bloxxed.

The clone will disappear after a set amount of time.

## Changes
In-order to have this tool work with updated Roblox features some changes were made to the 
implementation and functionality of the tool.

- A new R15 animation is used
- A modified R6 animation is used
- Modified MouseIcon script
- Configuration option table
